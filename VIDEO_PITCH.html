    <h1>🎥 JurisLens: The 3.5-Minute Video Pitch Script</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Hackathon Judges & Enterprise Compliance Officers</p>
        <p><strong>Core Message:</strong> "Generative AI reads rules. Agentic AI <em>enforces</em> them. JurisLens
            bridges the gap between static policy and live enterprise state using Elasticsearch."</p>
    </div>

    <h2><span class="timestamp">0:00 - 0:40</span> The Problem: "The Blind Spot of GenAI"</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>Audio 01:</strong> "Web search engines are great at reading, but terrible at enforcing. Meet
            JurisLens: The first Autonomous Compliance Agent that bridges the gap between static policy documents and
            live enterprise data."
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>Audio 02:</strong> "We all know LLMs can read. I can feed a 50-page banking regulation PDF into a
            standard chatbot and ask if a $4,000 transfer is allowed. It will read the rule limit of $5,000 and say YES.
            But in the real world, compliance isn't just about reading rules. It's about knowing the state of the bank."
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>Audio 03:</strong> "The chatbot is blind. It doesn't know that this specific client already
            transferred $2,500 this morning. It approves a transaction that actually violates the daily aggregate
            limit."
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2><span class="timestamp">0:40 - 1:10</span> The Solution: JurisLens</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>Audio 04:</strong> "Enter JurisLens. An Autonomous Agent built on the Elastic Stack. It uses Hybrid
            Search—combining vector semantic understanding with keyword precision—to find the exact regulation you
            need."
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2><span class="timestamp">1:10 - 2:20</span> The Killer Demo: "Project CHIMERA"</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>Audio 05:</strong> "Watch this. We ingest a confidential internal policy PDF. JurisLens indexes it
            instantly into Elasticsearch for real-time retrieval."
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>Audio 06:</strong> "First, we verify the rule. The agent cites the policy with a high Relevance
            Score of 92%, confirming the limit for Zylaria transfers is $5,000."
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>Audio 07:</strong> "Now, the real test. We ask: 'My client wants to send $4,000 to Zylaria. Is this
            allowed?' Check the sidebar."
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>Audio 08:</strong> "Boom. DENIED. The agent didn't just read the PDF. It checked the Live Ledger,
            found a prior $2,500 transfer, calculated the total exposure of $6,500, and blocked the transaction. This is
            Agentic Reasoning."
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2><span class="timestamp">2:20 - 2:45</span> Scenario 2: Universal Compliance Orchestration</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>Audio 09:</strong> "But it's not just about money. JurisLens creates a universal compliance layer.
            If I try to onboard a new client named Ivan Drago..."
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>Audio 10:</strong> "It instantly switches tools, scans global sanctions lists, and flags him as a
            blocked entity. One agent, multiple defense lines."
        </div>
